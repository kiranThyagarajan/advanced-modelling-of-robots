\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
% A brief introduction of the context. No need to describe the full lab, I know it. Try to make this introduction more personal (to prepare the reader to the rest of the report).
% The report is only due for the work on the Biglide

\section{Comparison of models}
% Prove me here that your model matches with Gazebo simulation. Figures are more than welcome. Take the time to make them nicer than the scope provided with the lab. You can use any mean you prefer as long as your figures are nice and CORRECTLY LABELED!!!
% No need to give me the computation of the models here. You already did it during the lab (if not, this is very wrong).
% Give me also some results to see how good your model performs (mean, max error, etc...). Matplotlib is a good start if you want to do it using python. (But you can also export the results and use an other solution).
% Comment wisely

\section{Control}
% Detail me here your trajectory, and how good you Computed Torque Controller does the work. 
% Details your results (how good the convergence is when you do not start at the initial point, did you try different gains, what is you mean, max error, what trajectories did you try).
% Make some interpretation of your results.

\section{Conclusion}
% Take some time here. Explain what goals you reached an which on you failed (if any) and try to detail why.
% It recall what is the practical knowledge that you get during this lab.
